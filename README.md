This project consists of a node/sqlite backend and a react frontend. The backend scrapes a users' channels for spotify links and queries spotify for some extra related information and stores it in a sqlite db and also serves the scraped data. The frontend simply displays the scraped/compiled data with some extra niceties. This is a port of slackSlongAggregator to instead connect to the groupme push api over websockets vs. slack's real time message api over websockets.
